              Manual transmission synchronizers (or &ldquo;synchros&rdquo;) are
              a critical, though often misunderstood, component to smooth gear
              shifting. These mechanical components inside your manual
              transmission make it possible to shift gears without grinding or
              forcing them together. They do this, as their name suggests, by
              synchronizing the speed of the gear being selected with the speed
              of the transmission shaft. Without them, you would have to
              perfectly rev-match for every upshift and downshift to prevent
              grinding (and possibly damaging) gears.

            <ul className="list-disc leading-loose">
              <li>
                Shift Begins: You move the gear lever and push the shift fork

              </li>
              <li>
                Slider Moves: A sleeve (or collar) moves over toward the gear
                you want by pushing against a synchro ring.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blocking Ring (Synchro Ring): This ring, usually made of brass
                or a similar soft metal, uses friction to slow down or speed up
                the target gear.
              </li>
              <li>
                Speed Match: Once the speeds are synchronized, the collar locks
                into the gear via small teeth (called dog teeth).
              </li>
              <li>
                Gear Engaged: Now the collar is locked into gear and the

              <li>
                Worn synchros: Synchros are commonly made of brass or some other
                high-friction material and will eventually wear. You&apos;ll
                start noticing grinding during gear changes, especially when
                downshifting as the synchros become worn out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hard shifting: If the synchros are damaged or worn out, shifting
                may feel notchy or grind when going into gear as the gear and
                transmission shaft are spinning at different rates.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className="space-y-10 mt-10">
              <p>
                Replacing worn sychros involves disassembly and rebuilding of
                the transmission. Worn synchro rings will need to be replaced,
                gear mating surfaces inspected and possibly re-finished and
                damaged gears may need to be replaced.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                At VDM we&apos;ve spent months testing different synchros,
                refinishing gear mating surfaces and trying various gear fluids
                to find the best combination for both durability and
                performance.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out that not all synchros are created equal. New
                materials and manufacturing technology has allowed the creation
                of both more durable as well as more effective synchros. When
                combined with hand finished gear mating surfaces we&apos;ve
                found that these allow for incredibly smooth shifts throughout
                the entire RPM range with minimal break-in while operating
                across a wide range of operating temperatures

              While OEM transmission gears are produced in vast quantities with
              considerable expertise, they are also designed and manufactured
              with cost constraints in mind. This often leads to the omission of
              certain processes that, while not essential for typical road cars,
              are highly beneficial in high-performance applications.

              Cryogenic Metal Treatment:
            </h3>
            <p className="text-black">
              Originally developed by NASA, cryogenic treatment involves
              carefully cooling components to extremely low temperatures (as low
              as -300Â°F) using liquid nitrogen, followed by a gradual return to
              room temperature. To prevent thermal shock, the gears are never
              directly exposed to the liquid nitrogen.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black">
              The primary goal of cryogenic treatment is to transform retained
              austenite and increase the hardness of the material&apos;s
              structure. Cryo-treated gears exhibit a measurable improvement in
              wear resistance and bending fatigue life, while also minimizing
              residual stress and the risk of stress fractures.
            </p>

              REM / Isotropic Surface Finishing (ISF):
            </h3>
            <p className="text-black">
              Standard transmissions can take months or even years to fully
              break in and develop optimal mating surfaces. ISF finishing
              dramatically accelerates this process by creating a near-polished,
              omni-directional surface on the gears. Unlike conventional
              polishing methods, ISF employs a non-abrasive chemical-mechanical
              process that selectively removes surface peaks without affecting
              the valleys. This ensures that the critical case-hardened surface
              remains intact, and dimensional tolerances are maintained.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black">
              The result is a jewel-like polish that significantly reduces
              friction, leading to smoother, cooler operation and reduced
              parasitic drag. ISF-treated surfaces also exhibit fewer stress
              raisers and increased resistance to corrosion and micropitting.
